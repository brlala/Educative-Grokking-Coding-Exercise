# Two Heap Problem
Python always uses min heap, so when putting into max heap you need to add `-`
1. choose one heap as main, add to max heap if num is smaller than biggest number in max heap
2. balance the heap
```

    max_heap = []  # containing first half of numbers

# Top K Numbers
1. using a heap to track the largest/smallest number
2. basic optimization for space complexity is to only keep K elements in the heap

4. remember to negate the value if you're using a max_heap

Knapsack Pattern
1. Find out the recursive algorithm
2. memoize TOP DOWN, BOTTOM UP
3. For Top Down, create a DP, initialize it then read from dp/save to dp
4. for bottom up, create a program then disintegrate it
``` 

```

Topological Sort
1. Initialize the graph and in-degrees(how many dependencies a node have)
2. Build the graph
3. Find all sources i.e., all vertices with 0 in-degrees
4. For each source, add it to the sortedOrder and subtract one from all of it if a child's in-degree becomes zero, add it to the sources queue
```
    sorted_order = []
    if vertices <= 0:
        return sorted_order
    # a. Initialize the graph
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(vertices)}  # count of incoming edges
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(vertices)}  # adjacency list graph

    # b. Build the graph
    for parent, child in edges:
        graph[parent].append(child)  # put the child into parent's list
        in_degree[child] += 1  # increment child's in-degree

    # c. Find all sources i.e., all vertices with 0 in-degrees
    sources = deque()
    for key, value in in_degree.items():
        if value == 0:
            sources.append(key)

            in_degree[child] -= 1  # how many arrows pointing to the node
            if in_degree[child] == 0:
                sources.append(child)

    # topological sort is not possible as the graph has a cycle
    if len(sorted_order) != vertices:
