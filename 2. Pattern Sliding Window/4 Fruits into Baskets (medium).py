# Problem Statement # Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two
# baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket
# can have only one type of fruit.
#
# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each
# tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
#
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
